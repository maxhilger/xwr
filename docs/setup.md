# Hardware Setup

!!! abstract "TL;DR"

    A mmWave radar I/Q data collection system consists of two parts:

    1. A radar with a Low Voltage Differential Signaling (LVDS) debug port which dumps out raw data, and
    2. A capture card which translates these LVDS signals into ethernet packets.

    To use these components with our [`radar`][xwr.radar] and [`capture`][xwr.capture] interfaces, the radar needs to be flashed with firmware with LVDS streaming enabled, while the capture cards need to be configured to read the output signals.

## DCA1000EVM Capture Card

!!! danger "ESD Sensitive"

    In our experience, the DCA1000EVM is particularly fragile; be careful with electrostatic discharge (ESD).

![DCA1000EVM](images/dca1000evm.jpg){: style="width: 50%"}

Ensure that the following DIP switches are set:

- SW2.5: `SW_CONFIG`
- SW2.6: `USER_SW1` (the marked right side), unless the EEPROM is messed up from a misconfigured [`configure_eeprom`][xwr.capture.DCA1000EVM.configure_eeprom] call.

The `DC_JACK_5V_IN` (the large switch on the side) should also be set, depending on whether the FPGA will be powered via the DC jack or via the radar.

??? info "Hardware Configuration Switches (Optional)"

    The following are configured by [`configure_fpga`][xwr.capture.DCA1000EVM.configure_fpga] under normal operation, but can be manually set in case that isn't working:

    - SW1: 16-bit mode (`16BIT_ON`, `14BIT_OFF`, `12BIT_OFF`).
    - SW2.1: `LVDS_CAPTURE`
    - SW2.2: `ETH_STREAM`
    - SW2.3: `AR1642_MODE` (2-lane LVDS)
    - SW2.4: `RAW_MODE`
    - SW2.5: `HW_CONFIG`

## AWR1843Boost

!!! info "Firmware"

    After installing the [mmWave SDK](https://www.ti.com/tool/MMWAVE-SDK), the firmware can be found at `demo/xwr18xx/mmwave/xwr18xx_mmw_demo.bin` in the install directory.

!!! tip

    Setting the large power switch on the DCA1000EVM to `RADAR_5V_IN`, a single power supply connected to the radar is sufficient to power the entire system.

</div>

1. Prepare for flashing.

    - Connect a micro-USB cable to the port on the radar, and power the radar on by connecting its power supply.
    - Find `SOP2:0` (DIP switches on the front of the radar). Set the switches to `SOP2:0=101`, where 1 corresponds to the "on" position labeled on the PCB.
    - Find switch `S2` in the middle of the radar, and set it to `SPI` (lower position).

2. Flash using [TI UniFlash](https://www.ti.com/tool/UNIFLASH).

    !!! note

        UniFlash seems to work most reliably on windows.

    - Uniflash should automatically discover the radar. If not, select the `AWR1843Boost` device.
    - Select the `xwr18xx_mmw_demo.bin` image to flash.
    - Choose the serial port corresponding to the radar; the serial port should have a name/description `XDS110 Class Application/User UART`.
    - Flashing should take around 1 minute, and terminate with "Program Load completed successfully".

    ??? failure "`Not able to connect to serial port. Recheck COM port selected and/or permissions.`"

        If the SOP switches or `S2` are not in the correct position, flashing will fail with
        ```
        Not able to connect to serial port.
        Recheck COM port selected and/or permissions.
        ```

3. Set the radar to functional mode: `SOP2:0=001`.

    !!! note
    
        mmWave studio expects the radar to be in *debug* mode (`SOP2:0=011`), so switching between `xwr` and mmWave Studio requires the position of the SOP switches to be changed. This is also why mmWave studio requires the MSS firmware to be "re-flashed" whenever the radar is rebooted.

## AWR1843AOP

!!! info "Firmware"

    After installing the [mmWave SDK](https://www.ti.com/tool/MMWAVE-SDK), the firmware can be found at `demo/xwr18xx/mmwave/xwr18xx_mmw_aop_demo.bin` in the install directory.

??? warning "[SICP2105 drivers](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) must be installed to flash the radar."

    As per the AWR1843AOPEVM [user manual](https://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/spruix8), the SICP2105 drivers must be installed to access the UART port during the flashing process. 
    
    If these drivers are not (properly) installed, the serial ports will appear as an "Enhanced Com Port" and "Standard Com Port" with a warning icon in the windows device manager.
    
    Download and install the drivers [here](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers): after downloading, go to
    ```
    device manager > Standard / Enhanced Com Port > Update Drivers > Browse my computer for drivers
    ```
    then select the folder containing the drivers you downloaded. You may need to do this twice: once for the "Enhanced Com Port", and once for the "Standard Com Port".

</div>

1. Prepare the radar for flashing.

    - Connect a micro-USB cable to the port on the radar. The additional power supply is not needed for this step.
    - Find `SOP0`, `SOP`, `SOP2`. `SOP2` is all the way on the left, while `SOP0` and `SOP1` are on the right-most block of 4 switches.
    - Set `SOP2:0=001`. In both cases, on (1) is up.

    ??? quote "Switch Positions"

        | S2 | any | any | any | any |
        | S3 | ON  |     |     |     |

2. Flash using [TI UniFlash](https://www.ti.com/tool/UNIFLASH).

    !!! warning

        Make sure the DCA1000EVM capture card, if connected, is not powered on. If the capture card is powered, flashing will fail with `Received Unexpected Data`.

    - Select the `AWR1843` device.
    - Select the `xwr18xx_mmw_aop_demo.bin` image to flash.
    - Choose the serial port corresponding to the `Silicon Labs Dual CP2105 USB to UART Bridge: Enhanced`.

3. Set the radar to functional, DCA1000EVM mode.

    - DIP Switch 2 (center), position 2 should be on (up). All other switches should be off (down).

1. Prepare for flashing.

    - Connect a micro-USB cable to the port on the radar, and power the radar on by connecting its power supply.
    - Find `SOP2:0`, and short SOP0 and SOP2 (`SOP2:0=101`). These are physical jumpers, which must be shorted using jumper caps or wires.

2. Flash using [TI UniFlash](https://www.ti.com/tool/UNIFLASH).

    !!! note

        UniFlash seems to work most reliably on windows.

    - Uniflash should automatically discover the radar. If not, select the `AWR1642Boost` device.

        Recheck COM port selected and/or permissions.
        ```

3. Set the radar to functional mode: `SOP2:0=001`.

## AWR2944EVM

!!! info "Firmware"

    After installing the [mmWave MCU Plus SDK](https://www.ti.com/tool/MMWAVE-MCUPLUS-SDK), you will need two firmware files:
    
    - `mmwave_mcuplus_sdk_{version}/ti/demo/awr294x/mmw/awr2944_mmw_demoTDM.appimage`: main application image.
    - `mmwave_mcuplus_sdk_{version}/tools/awr294x/sbl_qspi.release.tiimage`: bootloader image.

!!! warning

    Flashing the AWR2944EVM requires two jumper caps or wires in order to physically short the required pins. One of these jumpers must remain on the board to set it to functional mode.

!!! warning "Requires External 12v Power"

    The AWR2944EVM requires external 12v power to operate, while the DCA1000EVM requires external 5v power.
    
    ??? danger "Both power supplies have the same barrel jack size, and mixing them up will immediately destroy the DCA1000EVM."

        Don't ask me how I know this!

    We recommend labeling the power supplies at the barrel jack end, as well as connecting the radar power supply first (so that if the radar does not power on, you know that you've mixed them up).


1. Prepare for flashing.

    - Plug in a USB cable to the XDS port (on the right side).
    - Find `SOP2:0`, and short SOP0 and SOP2 (`SOP2:0=101`). These are physical jumpers, which must be shorted using jumper caps or wires.
    - Power on the radar using external 12v power.

2. Flash using [TI UniFlash](https://www.ti.com/tool/UNIFLASH).

    !!! note

        UniFlash seems to work most reliably on windows.

    - Uniflash should automatically discover the radar. If not, select the `AWR2944EVM` device.
    - Select the `awr2944_mmw_demoTDM.appimage` and `sbl_qspi.release.tiimage` images to flash.
    - Choose the serial port corresponding to the radar; the serial port should have a name/description `XDS110 Class Application/User UART`.
    - Flashing should take around 1 minute, and terminate with "Program Load completed successfully".

    ??? failure "Not able to connect to serial port. Recheck COM port selected and/or permissions."

        If the SOP switches or `S2` are not in the correct position, flashing will fail with
        ```
        Not able to connect to serial port.
        Recheck COM port selected and/or permissions.
        ```

3. Switch the radar to functional mode.

    - Remove the jumper on SOP2, so only a jumper on SOP0 remains (`SOP2:0=001`).

## AWR2944PEVM

!!! info "Firmware"

    Install the [mmWave MCU Plus SDK](https://www.ti.com/tool/MMWAVE-MCUPLUS-SDK) (`04.07.02.01` or later; earlier versions do not support the AWR2944P). You will need two firmware files:

    - `mmwave_mcuplus_sdk_{version}/ti/demo/awr294x/mmw/awr2944P_mmw_demoTDM.appimage`: main application image.
    - `mmwave_mcuplus_sdk_{version}/tools/awr294x/sbl_qspi.release.tiimage`: bootloader image.

!!! warning "Same hardware caveats as the AWR2944EVM"

    The AWR2944PEVM is the same board design as the [AWR2944EVM](#awr2944evm): it needs the same two jumper caps for `SOP2:0`, and the same external 12v supply (do not mix it up with the DCA1000EVM's 5v supply).

!!! bug "TI UniFlash does not support the AWR2x44P"

    Per TI, the UniFlash GUI cannot flash the AWR2944P; use the `uart_uniflash.py` script shipped with the MCU Plus SDK instead (`mcu_plus_sdk_awr294x_{version}/tools/boot/uart_uniflash.py`). See the [AWR2544LOPEVM](#awr2544lopevm) instructions for an example invocation.

1. Prepare for flashing: identical to the [AWR2944EVM](#awr2944evm) (`SOP2:0=101`, USB to the XDS port, 12v power).

2. Flash both images using `uart_uniflash.py`, selecting the serial port with description `XDS110 Class Application/User UART` (the lower-numbered `/dev/ttyACM*` on linux).

3. Switch the radar to functional mode: remove the jumper on SOP2, so only a jumper on SOP0 remains (`SOP2:0=001`).

!!! note "CLI differences"

    The AWR2x44P (like the AWR2544) has a 25MHz ethernet oscillator clock output, so its `channelCfg` takes two extra arguments, `<ethOscClkEn> <driveStrength>`. The RF front end and antenna array are unchanged, so the `AWR2944EVM` signal processing class still applies.

## AWRL6844EVM

!!! info "Firmware"

    Install the [MMWAVE-L-SDK](https://www.ti.com/tool/MMWAVE-L-SDK). You can find the demo firmware at
    ```

        - Set the undocumented switches (S5) to OFF.
        - Set all S1 switches to off except S1.2, which should be on.
        - Set all S4 switches to off.

2. Flash using [TI UniFlash](https://www.ti.com/tool/UNIFLASH).

    - Select `AWRL68XX` as the device. This will not be detected automatically.
    - Select the `mmwave_demo.release.appimage` image to flash.
    - Choose the serial port corresponding to the radar; the serial port should have a name/description `XDS110 Class Application/User UART`.
    - Flashing should take around 1 minute, and terminate with "Program Load completed successfully".

3. Switch the radar to functional mode.

    - Follow [this flashing guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/swru636/swru636.pdf?ts=1772012346542):
